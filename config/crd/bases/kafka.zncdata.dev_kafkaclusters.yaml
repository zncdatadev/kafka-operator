                              3. The permission bits are OR'd with rw-rw----


                              If unset, the Kubelet will not modify the ownership and permissions of any volume.
                              Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.

                                    to be owned by the pod:


                                    1. The owning GID will be the FSGroup

                                    If unset, the Kubelet will not modify the ownership and permissions of any volume.

                                    before being exposed inside Pod. This field will only apply to
                                    volume types which support fsGroup based ownership(and permissions).
                                    It will have no effect on ephemeral volume types such as: secret, configmaps
                                    and emptydir.
                                    Valid values are "OnRootMismatch" and "Always". If not specified, "Always" is used.

                                    May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and
                                    PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence
                                    for that container.
                                    Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
